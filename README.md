# SimpleAndroidImageSlider

This is a sample of a very simple image slider with circulars indicators for Android.
It uses a ViewPager to show the images, and a linear layout to hold the circular indicators.
The circular indicators are added programmatically according to the size of the array that contains the resource ids of the images.
It is a good place to start if you intend to build your own image slider
